**It Plays Tetris**

A very minimal Gameboy emulator - the only requirement is that it will run Tetris in a vaguely playable way. Noway near accurate, and anything that isn't required to run Tetris is likely not implemented (unless I implemented it by accident without realising Tetris doesn't need it). Also there's no sound, you'll just have to imagine the amazing Tetris music.
