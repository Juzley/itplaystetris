**It Plays Tetris**

A very minimal Gameboy emulator - the only requirement is that it will run Tetris in a vaguely playable way. Noway near accurate, and anything that isn't required to run Tetris is likely not implemented (unless I implemented it by accident without realising Tetris doesn't need it). Also there's no sound, you'll just have to imagine the amazing Tetris music.

You probably don't want to run it, but incase you do you'll need a Gameboy boot ROM (the original gameboy, none of this fancy color stuff) and a Tetris ROM. Stick them in the folder you want to run from, named dmg_boot.bin and cartridge.gb, respectively.
